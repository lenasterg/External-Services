### How to install this sample app
This sample app has been created on top of Laravel 5. Therefore the setup is exactly the same as installing a Laravel 5 application.

```
git clone git@github.com:Vugario/External-Services.git
cd External-Services
cp .env.example .env
```

Now we to make the directory cache into the bootstrap and give write permissions. Also give the storage directory write permissions.
```
mkdir bootstrap/cache
chmod -R 0777 bootstrap/cache/
chmod -R 0777 storage/
```

Lets run [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to fetch our dependencies. 

```
composer install
```

Now lets generate our key. Run the following command
```
php artisan key:generate
```
and type 'yes' if prompt. 

Now that we have the code and key lets configure the app. Open up the .env file and edit your database settings. Run the following commands to populate your db

```
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

The seeding process will create a shipping method and some payment methods. These will demonstrate the basic use of these methods.

Now your ready!

GET `http://localhost/External-Services/public/shipment_methods` should return a list of shipment methods and `http://localhost/External-Services/public/payment_methods` will give you payment methods.
